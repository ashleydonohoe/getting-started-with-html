		<h1>Important Concepts</h1>
		<h3>World Wide Web</h3>
		<p>The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> was invented in the 1990s and is a collection of HTML documents. Hyperlinks link pages to make the <em>web</em> like an actual web. It can contain plain text, music, video, image, and HTML files. A <strong>computer browser</strong> makes a request to the Internet, and servers respond with files for browser to display. The <strong>HTTP protocol</strong> is used by browser to communicate with servers.</p>
		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<p><strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> documents are made of the text content you see, markup which is what the content looks like, references to other documents, and links to other pages.</p>
		<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
		<p><strong>Markup</strong> is needed to make text look different than plain text. Markup is made up of tags that have a less than symbol, tag name, greater than symbol, tag contents, another less than symbol with a slash, tag name, and last greater than symbol. There's an opening and closing tag (has slash). Two tags with content are known as an element.</p>
		<p>The "b" tag is the <b>bold</b> tag, although the "strong" tag can also be used. The "em" tag makes things <em>italicized</em>. The "a" tag is for inserting a <a href="www.udacity.com">link</a>. The "img" tag is for inserting images.</p>
		<h3>Why Computers Are Stupid</h3>
		<p>Computers can only understand instructions we humans give them. This means they're sensitive to things like typos and small errors (like a missing end tag).</p>
		<h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
		<p><strong>Attributes</strong> are used with tags and are in quotes. Tags can have multiple of them. The "a" (or anchor) tag is one example, which is "href" followed by an equal sign and a link in quotes. The "img" tag uses the "src" attribute followed by an equal sign and URL in quotes. The "img" tag also needs an "alt" attribute with alternative text, but it has a void, rather than closing, tag since it has no content.</p>
		<h3>Whitespace</h3>
		<p>All <strong>whitespace</strong> in HTML turns out as a single space. You can use the "br" tag (with void tag) to place a line break. Multiple "br" tags can be used. The "p" (or paragraph tag) also can be used for line breaks. In other programming languages, "\n" is used for line breaks.</p>
		<h3>Inline vs. Block Elements</h3>
		<p>The "br", "em", "strong", "b", and "img" tags are inline elements. The "p" tag makes an actual invisible box, so it's a block element.</p>
		<p>A <strong>span</strong> is inline, while a <strong>div</strong> is block that will create a box around a piece of text. Styles can be attached to them. CSS classes can be used with them.</p>
		<h3>HTML Document Structure</h3>
		<p>The structure consists of the doctype, "html", "head" (with "title" tags and links to JS and CSS), and "body" (for actual content of document) opening and closing tags.</p>
